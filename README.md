# Horiseon Code Refctor

## Purpose
My purpose in this project was to aid the Horiseon company in a refactor of their website's code. The look of the website was untouched but code was consolidated, cleaned up, and updated for accessibility.

## Changes Made
* Title was changed from "Website" to "Horiseon.
* Elements in HTML moved up so there were no blank lines.
* Tab Elements and their nesting elements so opening and closing tags line up.
* Changed <div> to <header> and changes corresponding css selectors.
* The <div> under <header> was changes to <nav> and changed corresponding css selectors.
* I changed a selector in css to header a
* I gave an id to search-engine-optimization in html so the link now works.
* Changed <div> to <article> to group those sections with their corresponding material and changed corresponding css selectors.
* I consolidated css for all article selectors.
* I consolidated css for all article h2 selectors.
* I consolidated css for all article img selectors.
* I gave the column section on the right of the web page a <section> tag.
* I gave all <div> in the right column section a class of "benefit" so I could combine their css such elements as h3 and img.
* I added alt descriptions for images in the middle horizontal section.
* I added alt="" to images in the right column section.
I got rid of the class footer and changed the <div> in that section to <footer> and changes the corresponding css.
* I added html and css comments to better distinguish between sections.
